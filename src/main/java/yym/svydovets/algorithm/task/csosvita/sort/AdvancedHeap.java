/*
 * In traditional PriorityQueue implementations, removing an arbitrary element has
 * a time complexity of O(n) because it may require scanning the entire queue to find the element.
 * Your task is to design and implement a modified version of a priority queue
 * that supports removing an arbitrary element faster.
 *
 * There are 3 types of query:
 * "1 v" - Add an element v to the heap.
 * "2 v" - Delete the element v from the heap.
 * "3"   - Print the minimum of all the elements in the heap.
 *
 * It is guaranteed that the element to be deleted will be there in the heap.
 * At ant instant, only distinct elements will be in the heap.
 *
 * 1 <= Q (queries) <= 10^5
 * -10^9 <= v <= 10^9
