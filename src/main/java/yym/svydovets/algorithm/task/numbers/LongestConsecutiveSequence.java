  Given an unsorted array of integers nums, return the length of the longest consecutive elements sequence.
  You must write an algorithm that runs in O(n) time.
  Example 1:
  Input: nums = [100,4,200,1,3,2] ; 0,3,7,2,5,8,4,6,0,1
  Output: 4                       ; 9
  Explanation: The longest consecutive elements sequence is [1, 2, 3, 4]. Therefore its length is 4.
