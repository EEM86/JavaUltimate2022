 * Medium (UnionFind algorithm for the solution)
 * Complexity: time - O(log n), space - O(n)
 *
 * You have a graph of n nodes. You are given an integer n
 * and an array edges where edges[i] = [Ai, Bi] indicates
 * that there is an edge between A1 and B1 in the graph.
 * Return the number of connected components in the graph;
 *
 * Example:
 * [ 0 ] --- [ 1 ]    [ 3 ]
 *             |        |
 *           [ 2 ]    [ 4 ]
 * Input: n = 5, edges = [[0,1],[1,2],[3,4]]
 * Output: 2
